# Quick Fix Summary

## The Issue
Your OpenAI API key in `.env` is incomplete/truncated: `sk-proj-eMV2ES_jhgjhg`

## The Fix
1. **Get your complete OpenAI API key** (should be 51+ characters, much longer than what you have)
2. **Update `.env` file** with the complete key
3. **Restart the server**: `npm start`

## Current Status
✅ Server is running at http://localhost:3000  
✅ All dependencies installed  
❌ Need complete API key  

## Test After Fix
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-4o-mini","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}]}'
```

Should return an AI response instead of authentication error.

The server is working - you just need to provide the complete API key!
