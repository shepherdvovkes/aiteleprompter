# API Connection Error - Fix Guide

## Problem Analysis

The "API connection failed" error occurs because the application requires a valid OpenAI API key to function properly. The application uses the OpenAI API for:
- Speech recognition processing
- AI-powered conversation analysis
- Question detection and answering

## Current Issue Diagnosis

✅ Server is running successfully at http://localhost:3000
✅ Dependencies are installed correctly
✅ `.env` file exists
❌ **MAIN ISSUE**: API key in `.env` file is incomplete/truncated

**Current API key**: `sk-proj-eMV2ES_jhgjhg` (truncated)
**Error from server**: "Incorrect API key provided"

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Incomplete API Key**: The `.env` file contains a truncated OpenAI API key that's too short to be valid
2. **Client-side Configuration**: The application also requires API key configuration in the browser's localStorage
3. **API Key Format**: OpenAI API keys are typically 51+ characters long, but the current one is only 21 characters

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Fix the OpenAI API Key (Required)

#### Step 1: Get Your Complete OpenAI API Key
1. Check where you copied the API key from originally
2. The complete key should look like: `sk-proj-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`
3. If you don't have the complete key, get a new one:
   - Visit https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
   - Sign in to your OpenAI account
   - Click "Create new secret key"
   - Copy the COMPLETE API key (starts with `sk-proj-` and is much longer)

#### Step 2: Update the .env File
Edit the `.env` file and replace the current incomplete key:

**Current (broken):**
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-eMV2ES_jhgjhg
```

**Should be (with your complete key):**
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-YOUR_COMPLETE_API_KEY_HERE_MUCH_LONGER
```

#### Step 3: Restart the Server
```bash
# Stop the current server
pkill -f "node server.js"

# Start the server again
npm start
```

#### Step 4: Configure Client-side API Key (Alternative Option)
If you prefer to use client-side API configuration instead:
1. Open the application in your browser: http://localhost:3000
2. Click the "Settings" button (gear icon)
3. Enter your COMPLETE OpenAI API key in the "OpenAI API Key" field
4. Click "Save"

### Solution 2: Using Server-side API (Recommended)

With a properly configured `.env` file, the application will:
1. Use the server endpoint `/api/chat` for API calls
2. Handle authentication on the server side
3. Provide better security and error handling

To test if it's working:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-4o-mini","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}]}'
```

You should get a proper AI response instead of an authentication error.

## Verification Steps

1. **Test Server Endpoint**: 
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
   ```
   Should return: `{"status":"ok","timestamp":"...","cache_size":0}`

2. **Test API Connection**: 
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/chat \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"model":"gpt-4o-mini","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"test"}]}'
   ```
   Should return a proper AI response, not an authentication error.

3. **Test Web Application**: 
   - Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
   - Click "Start" to begin speech recognition
   - Should see "Connected to API" instead of "API connection failed"

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: "Incorrect API key provided" Error
- **Cause**: API key is incomplete, expired, or invalid
- **Fix**: Get the complete API key from OpenAI dashboard and update `.env`

### Issue 2: "API key not configured" Error (Client-side)
- **Cause**: No API key set in localStorage AND server-side key not working
- **Fix**: Configure API key in both `.env` file and browser settings

### Issue 3: "API status 401" Error
- **Cause**: Authentication failed
- **Fix**: Verify your complete API key is correct

### Issue 4: "API status 429" Error
- **Cause**: Rate limit exceeded or insufficient credits
- **Fix**: Check your OpenAI account balance and usage limits

## Security Notes

- OpenAI API keys are sensitive credentials - keep them secure
- Never commit real API keys to version control
- The complete API key should be around 51+ characters long
- Monitor your OpenAI API usage and billing

## Current Status

✅ Server is running successfully at http://localhost:3000
✅ Dependencies are installed
✅ Environment file exists
❌ **ACTION NEEDED**: Update `.env` with complete OpenAI API key

## Next Steps

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Get your complete OpenAI API key (should be much longer than current truncated version)
2. Update the `.env` file with the complete key
3. Restart the server: `npm start`
4. Test the application at http://localhost:3000

The server is ready and waiting for a valid API key!
